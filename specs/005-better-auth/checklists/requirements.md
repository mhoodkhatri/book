# Specification Quality Checklist: Better-Auth Authentication

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-30
**Feature**: [specs/005-better-auth/spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation.
- Assumptions section documents key decisions (email service sender verification, Better-Auth as JS/TS service, OAuth out of scope).
- The spec references "Better-Auth" and "Neon Postgres" in Assumptions — these are documented constraints from the constitution, not implementation leaks. The functional requirements themselves are technology-agnostic.
- Ready for `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`.
