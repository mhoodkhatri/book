# Chapter 1: Isaac Sim

Welcome to the first chapter of Module 3. You'll learn to use **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**, a powerful simulation platform built on NVIDIA Omniverse.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

- Install and configure Isaac Sim
- Create photorealistic simulation environments
- Generate synthetic training data for ML models
- Integrate Isaac Sim with ROS 2

## Introduction to Isaac Sim
