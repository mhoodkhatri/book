# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain

**NVIDIA Isaac Platform** | Weeks 8-10

Welcome to Module 3, where you'll learn to give your robot an **AI brain** using NVIDIA Isaac. This platform provides GPU-accelerated perception, localization, and navigation capabilities.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Set up NVIDIA Isaac Sim for advanced simulation
- Integrate Isaac ROS packages with your robot
- Implement visual SLAM for localization
- Deploy Nav2 for autonomous navigation

## Module Overview

### Chapter 1: Isaac Sim
Master NVIDIA's next-generation robot simulator. Create photorealistic environments and generate synthetic training data for AI models.

### Chapter 2: Isaac ROS
Integrate Isaac ROS packages for GPU-accelerated perception. Leverage NVIDIA's optimized implementations of common robotics algorithms.

### Chapter 3: Visual SLAM
Implement visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM) for robot localization without GPS.

### Chapter 4: Nav2 Integration
Deploy the Navigation 2 (Nav2) stack for autonomous robot navigation. Configure path planning, obstacle avoidance, and goal seeking.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:

- Completed Modules 1 and 2
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS 2 Humble

## Getting Started

Begin with [Chapter 1: Isaac Sim](/docs/module-3-nvidia-isaac/isaac-sim) to explore NVIDIA's advanced simulation platform.
