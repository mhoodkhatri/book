# Chapter 3: Python Client Library (rclpy)

In this chapter, you'll master **rclpy**, the Python client library for ROS 2. We'll cover best practices, error handling, and advanced patterns for writing production-quality robot code.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

- Structure ROS 2 Python packages correctly
- Use executors for efficient callback management
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Write maintainable, testable robot code

## Getting Started with rclpy

rclpy provides the Python interface to ROS 2's core functionality.
