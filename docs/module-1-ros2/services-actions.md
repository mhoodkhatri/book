# Chapter 2: Services and Actions

In this chapter, you'll learn about two more communication patterns in ROS 2: **services** for synchronous request-response interactions and **actions** for long-running operations with feedback.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

- Implement ROS 2 services for request-response communication
- Create action servers and clients for long-running tasks
- Handle action feedback and cancellation
- Choose the appropriate communication pattern for your use case

## Services

Services provide a synchronous request-response pattern. A client sends a request and waits for a response from the server.

*Content coming soon...*

## Actions

Actions are designed for long-running tasks that need feedback during execution and the ability to be cancelled.

## Hands-on Exercise

*Exercise content coming soon...*

## Summary

You've learned how services and actions complement topics to provide a complete communication toolkit for robot programming.

## Next Steps

Continue to [Chapter 3: Python Client Library (rclpy)](/docs/module-1-ros2/rclpy) to master the Python interface for ROS 2.
