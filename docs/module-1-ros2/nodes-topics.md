# Chapter 1: Nodes and Topics

Welcome to the first chapter of Module 1. Here you'll learn about the two most fundamental concepts in ROS 2: **nodes** and **topics**.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

- Explain the role of nodes in ROS 2 architecture
- Create publisher and subscriber nodes
- Understand the DDS middleware layer
- Debug node communication using ROS 2 CLI tools

## What are Nodes?

Nodes are the fundamental computational units in ROS 2. Each node is an independent process that performs a specific function in your robot system.

## What are Topics?

Topics are named buses over which nodes exchange messages. They follow a publish-subscribe pattern where nodes can publish messages to topics and subscribe to receive messages from topics.

## Summary

In this chapter, you learned the fundamental building blocks of ROS 2 communication. In the next chapter, we'll explore services and actions for more complex interaction patterns.

## Next Steps

Continue to [Chapter 2: Services and Actions](/docs/module-1-ros2/services-actions) to learn about request-response patterns.
