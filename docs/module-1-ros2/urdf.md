# Chapter 4: Robot Description (URDF)

In this final chapter of Module 1, you'll learn to describe your robot's physical structure using **URDF** (Unified Robot Description Format).

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

- Write URDF files to describe robot geometry
- Define links (rigid bodies) and joints (connections)
- Use xacro for modular, reusable robot descriptions
- Visualize your robot in RViz

## Introduction to URDF

URDF is an XML format that describes a robot's physical properties including:

- Links: The rigid bodies that make up the robot
- Joints: The connections between links
- Visual properties: How the robot looks
- Collision properties: The shapes used for collision detection

## Summary

You've completed Module 1! You now understand the fundamental communication patterns and description formats used in ROS 2 robotics.

## Next Steps

Continue to [Module 2: The Digital Twin](/docs/module-2-simulation) to learn about robot simulation with Gazebo and Unity.
