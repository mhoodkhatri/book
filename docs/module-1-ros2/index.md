# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System

**ROS 2 Fundamentals** | Weeks 3-5

Welcome to the first module of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. In this module, you'll master ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), the industry-standard middleware that forms the "nervous system" of modern robots.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the ROS 2 architecture and its role in robotics
- Create and manage ROS 2 nodes for modular robot programming
- Implement publish-subscribe communication using topics
- Build request-response patterns with services
- Develop long-running operations using actions
- Program robots using the rclpy Python client library
- Describe robot geometry and kinematics using URDF

## Module Overview

### Chapter 1: Nodes and Topics
Learn the fundamental building blocks of ROS 2: nodes (the processes) and topics (the communication channels). Understand how robots decompose complex behaviors into modular, communicating components.

### Chapter 2: Services and Actions
Master synchronous request-response patterns with services and asynchronous long-running operations with actions. Build robust robot behaviors that handle real-world timing constraints.

### Chapter 3: Python Client Library (rclpy)
Dive deep into the Python interface for ROS 2. Write production-quality robot code using best practices, error handling, and the executor model.

### Chapter 4: Robot Description (URDF)
Describe your robot's physical structure using the Unified Robot Description Format. Create accurate models for visualization, simulation, and motion planning.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:

- Completed the course introduction
- Set up your development workstation
- Basic Python programming experience
- Ubuntu 22.04 or compatible Linux distribution

## Getting Started

Begin with [Chapter 1: Nodes and Topics](/docs/module-1-ros2/nodes-topics) to start building your ROS 2 foundation.
