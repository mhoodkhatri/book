# Edge Deployment Kit

This guide covers hardware for deploying your robot systems on edge devices.

## NVIDIA Jetson Platform

The NVIDIA Jetson platform is recommended for edge deployment:

### Jetson Orin Series

| Model | GPU Cores | RAM | Power | Use Case |
|-------|-----------|-----|-------|----------|
| Orin Nano | 1024 | 8 GB | 15W | Basic perception |
| Orin NX | 2048 | 16 GB | 25W | Full perception |
| AGX Orin | 2048 | 64 GB | 60W | Full autonomy |

## Getting Started with Jetson
