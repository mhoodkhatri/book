# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook for humanoid robotics development. This course takes you from the fundamentals of robot operating systems to the cutting edge of vision-language-action models.

## Course Overview

This textbook is organized into four progressive modules, each building upon the previous:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (Weeks 3-5)
Master the fundamentals of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), the industry-standard middleware for robot development. Learn to build robust, real-time communication systems between robot components.

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Weeks 6-7)
Create realistic simulations of your robots using Gazebo and Unity. Learn to test and validate robot behaviors in virtual environments before deploying to hardware.

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (Weeks 8-10)
Leverage NVIDIA Isaac for perception, localization, and navigation. Integrate state-of-the-art AI capabilities into your humanoid robots.

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (Weeks 11-13)
Explore the frontier of robotics AI with vision-language-action models. Build robots that can understand natural language commands and translate them into physical actions.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:

- Basic Python programming experience
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Understanding of basic physics and mathematics
- Access to a development workstation (see [Hardware Requirements](/docs/hardware/workstation))

## How to Use This Textbook

Each chapter includes:

- **Learning Objectives**: Clear goals for what you'll learn
- **Conceptual Explanations**: In-depth coverage of theory and principles
- **Hands-on Exercises**: Practical coding and robotics tasks
- **Code Examples**: Tested, working code you can run
- **Review Questions**: Test your understanding

## Getting Started
