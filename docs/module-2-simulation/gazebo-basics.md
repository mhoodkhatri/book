# Chapter 1: Gazebo Basics

Welcome to the first chapter of Module 2. You'll learn the fundamentals of **Gazebo**, the premier open-source robot simulator used throughout the robotics industry.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

- Install and configure Gazebo with ROS 2
- Create simulation worlds using SDF
- Spawn and control robots in simulation
- Bridge Gazebo and ROS 2 for communication

## Introduction to Gazebo

Gazebo is a powerful 3D robot simulator that provides accurate physics simulation, sensor simulation, and integration with ROS 2.
