# Chapter 4: Sensor Simulation

In this final chapter of Module 2, you'll learn to simulate the **sensors** that enable robot perception.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

- Simulate cameras with realistic noise models
- Generate LiDAR point clouds in simulation
- Model IMU and other proprioceptive sensors
- Configure sensor noise for realistic testing
