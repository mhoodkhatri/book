# Module 2: The Digital Twin

**Simulation with Gazebo & Unity** | Weeks 6-7

Welcome to Module 2, where you'll learn to create **digital twins** of your robots using industry-leading simulation tools. Simulation is essential for safe, rapid development of robot behaviors.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Set up and configure Gazebo for robot simulation
- Understand physics engines and their role in realistic simulation
- Integrate Unity for advanced visualization and environments
- Simulate sensors including cameras, LiDAR, and IMUs
- Test robot behaviors safely before hardware deployment

## Module Overview

### Chapter 1: Gazebo Basics
Get started with Gazebo, the open-source robot simulator. Learn to create worlds, spawn robots, and run your first simulations.

### Chapter 2: Physics Simulation
Understand how physics engines work and configure them for realistic robot behavior. Handle contacts, friction, and dynamics.

### Chapter 3: Unity Integration
Explore Unity for photo-realistic rendering and complex environment design. Bridge Unity with ROS 2 for hybrid simulation workflows.

### Chapter 4: Sensor Simulation
Simulate the sensors your robot needs: cameras, depth sensors, LiDAR, IMUs, and more. Generate realistic sensor data for perception algorithms.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:

- Completed Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals
- Working ROS 2 installation
- GPU with OpenGL support (recommended)

## Getting Started

Begin with [Chapter 1: Gazebo Basics](/docs/module-2-simulation/gazebo-basics) to start building your simulation environment.
