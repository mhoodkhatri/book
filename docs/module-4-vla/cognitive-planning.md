# Chapter 2: Cognitive Planning

In this chapter, you'll implement **cognitive planning** using language models to translate high-level instructions into robot actions.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

- Use LLMs for task decomposition
- Generate action sequences from instructions
- Handle ambiguity and error recovery
- Integrate planning with robot execution
