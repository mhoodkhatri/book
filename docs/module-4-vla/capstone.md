# Chapter 3: Capstone Project

Congratulations on reaching the final chapter! Here you'll apply everything you've learned in a comprehensive **capstone project**.

## Project Overview

In this capstone, you'll build a complete humanoid robot system that:

1. Perceives its environment using cameras and sensors
2. Understands spoken commands via Whisper
3. Plans actions using cognitive planning
4. Navigates autonomously with Nav2
5. Executes complex manipulation tasks

## Learning Objectives

After completing this project, you will be able to:

- Integrate all course components into a working system
- Debug complex multi-component robot systems
- Deploy and test on real or simulated hardware
- Document and present your robot solution
